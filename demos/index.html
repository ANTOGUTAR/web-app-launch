    <h1>Service Worker Launch Demo</h1>
    <p>This is a demo site for the Service Worker "launch" event polyfill.</p>
    <p>Because "launch" is not implemented in the browser, you need to use the
       <a href="simulatenavigate.html">Navigation Simulator</a>. Think of that
       as a test UI for generating incoming navigations into your website.</p>
    <p>This page acts as the "main page" of the site; it uses the "launch" event
       to steal any navigations to the "/compose" URL.</p>
