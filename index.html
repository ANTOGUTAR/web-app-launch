        This specification defines an API that allows web applications to
        configure the behaviour of app launches with respect to already open app
        instances. This API aims to cater to the needs of single instance web
        apps e.g. music players.

        WIP Notes

        Spec skeleton:
          Use case example with code:
            Music player.
          Extend manifest extension point:
            Process launch_handler field.
            Process inner route_to field
          IDLs:
            LaunchParams IDL:
              Note extensibility design; for members other than targetURL at
              most one will not be undefined depending on the type of launch.
            LaunchQueue IDL.
              Note why not events.
            window.launchQueue IDL.
          Define launch process:
            Define launch routing selection process:
              Define route_to values and their meanings.

      <h2>
        Prerequisites
      </h2>
      <p>
        In order to implement this API, a the user agent MUST support
        [[[appmanifest]]] and MUST support multiple simultaneous app instances.

      <h2>
        Usage Example
      </h2>
      <p>
        A music player app wants to direct app shortcut launches to an existing
        window without interrupting music playback. This music app would add a
        {{launch_handler}} entry to the [[[appmanifest]]], as shown:
      </p>
      <pre class="example json" title="manifest.webmanifest">
      {
        "name": "Music Player",
        "shortcuts": [{
          "name": "Now Playing",
          "url": "/"
        }, {
          "name": "Library",
          "url": "/library"
        }, {
          "name": "Favorites",
          "url": "/favorites"
        }, {
          "name": "Discover",
          "url": "/discover"
        }],
        "launch_handler": {
          "route_to": "existing-client-retain"
        }
      }
      </pre>
      <p>
        With the <a data-cite="LaunchHandler.route_to">route_to</a> parameter
        set to "existing-client-retain" causes app launches to bring existing
        app instances (if any) into focus without navigating them away from
        their current document.
      </p>
      <p>
        A {{LaunchParams}} will be enqueued on the {{window.launchQueue}} where
        the music player can read the {{targetURL}} in its {{LaunchConsumer}}
        and handle it in script e.g.:
      </p>
      <pre class="example javascript" title="page.js">
        window.launchQueue.addConsumer((launchParams) => {
          const url = launchParams.targetURL;
          // If the URL is to one of the app sections, updates the app view to
          // that section without interrupting currently playing music.
          if (maybeFocusAppSection(url)) {
            return;
          }
          location.href = url;
        });
      </pre>
      <p>
        A user, already using the music player app to listen to music,
        activating the "Library" app shortcut will trigger an app launch to
        /library which gets routed to the existing app instance, enqueued in the
        page's {{window.launchQueue}} which, through the assigned
        {{LaunchConsumer}}, brings the library section of the music player into
        focus without affecting the current music playback.

      <ul>
        <li>Invoking a <a>web share target</a> means potentially sending
        private user data to a third-party website. Implementors are to take
        every precaution that the user understands which party the data is
        being sent to (<i>e.g.</i>, communicating the web share target's
        origin), before running the <a>invocation</a> algorithm.
        </li>
        <li>Of particular concern is spoofing: a web share target presenting
        itself as a different party (by setting its name and icon accordingly).
        </li>
        <li>The spoofing risk is heightened if web share targets are chosen
        from an online index, rather than a set of targets that the end user
        has explicitly installed or registered.
        </li>
        <li>The requirement that the web share target's origin be a
        [=potentially trustworthy origin=] is to prevent private user data from
        being transmitted to a party that does not control the origin in
        question, or in clear text over the network.
        </li>
        <li>A source site using Web Share API, and a receipient site using Web
        Share Target, could cooperate to join user ids. The source site could
        use `navigator.share(text: my_id_for_this_user)`, and the (user-chosen)
        recipient could use that information to join its own user ID with the
        source origin's user ID. Both sides of the transfer would need to write
        code to accomplish the transfer, and the user would need to pick the
        recipient.
